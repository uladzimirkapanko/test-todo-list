## React Native Todo List

The goal of this exercise is to create a working todo list with persistent data storage.

To start with, we have a styled todo list that supports adding todos.
We also have premade styles for completed todo items.
Although there's no working mechanism for "completing" a todo.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on a todo item should toggle the "checked" state.
2. Checked items should sink to the bottom of the list automatically
